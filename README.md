# Quiz-Website

This is A simple web app for taking quizzes I created to better understand node.js and web apps.

To run the server first make sure you have node.js and javascript installed on your system. Next Go into the IDE terminal and type the following command without quotes 'npm start' .
Now navigate to the browser of your choice and go to 'localhost:3000'
